## Introduction

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection is a machine learning project aimed at detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a medical condition where the retina is damaged due to diabetes, which can lead to blindness if not detected early. This project leverages deep learning techniques to assist in the early detection of this condition.

## Features
- Preprocessing of retinal images
- Deep learning model for detection
- Evaluation metrics for performance
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset & Model Training
Diabetic retinopathy is a condition suffered by people who have diabeties, which leads to permenent blindness if not treated in time.

We propose a novel and efficient method to diagnose retinopathy from retinal fundas images using SVM .
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition. And the model used is trained using a ResNet-52 neural network architecture.

## Result
The model achieved a training accuracy of 96.01% and a validation accuracy of 93.2%, with a minimal loss of 0.136. On the test set, the accuracy was 92.32% with a loss of 0.149.
